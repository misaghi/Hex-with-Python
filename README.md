# Hex-with-Python
Hello. This is the University of Guilan AI course project.

The designed agent uses the Dijkstra algorithm to find the best path across the table. It also considers itself as the player and chooses either the best local (according to the player's last move) or a global move.

I used Negamax with alpha/beta pruning to find the heuristic with a search depth of 6, so it might be a little slow (they were demanding a depth of 4 btw). You can reduce the search depth to 4 if you'd like.

## How to Run?
Run ui.py in the terminal and you are good to go.

At the end please let me know if there are any issues with my game. I haven't seen any (because of little testing :D).

Thank you
